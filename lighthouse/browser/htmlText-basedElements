### Divisions & Spans

Divisions, or \<div\>s, and \<span\>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for styling purposes.

They are simply containers and not semantics.

## DIV

A \<div\> is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, and which helps to build a web page’s layout and design.

## SPAN

A \<span\>, on the other hand, is an inline-level element commonly used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block-level element.

## Important

---

div and span use class and id attributes to specify styling.

Choose the value of class or id on the basis of content in container and not randomly.

### Text-Based Elements

- Headings (Block level)

1. Range from <h1\> to <h6\> (big text to small)
2. Establish hierarchy
3. help search engines to index and determine the content on a page

- Paragraphs (Block level)

1. Headings are often followed by supporting paragraphs.
2. Paragraphs are defined using the \<p\> block-level element.

```
<p> ..... </p>
```

- Bold Text with Strong (inline)

There are two elements that will bold text for us: the <strong\> and <b\> elements.

choose each element cautiously.

The <strong\> element is semantically used to give strong importance to text, and is thus the most popular option for bolding text.

The <b\> element, on the other hand, semantically means to stylistically offset text, which isn’t always the best choice for text deserving prominent attention.

- Italian with <em\> emphasis (inline element)

The <em\> element is used semantically to place a stressed emphasis on text; it is thus the most popular option for italicizing text.

the <i\> element, is used semantically to convey text in an alternative voice or tone, almost as if it were placed in quotation marks.
